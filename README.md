The primary goal of this experiment is to investigate whether **font weight** (regular vs. bold) and **font type** (serif vs. sans-serif) are preattentives, meaning they can be processed automatically by the visual system without the need for focused attention. Specifically, we aim to test the following hypotheses:

- H1: Font weight is preattentive.
- H2: Font type is preattentive.
- H3: Font weight and font type are less distinguishable when combined than when presented in isolation.

In this experiment, participants will use a mouse to interact with a computer screen. The objective is to quickly identify a uniquely styled letter among a group of displayed letters. Participants begin by pressing 'Enter,' which presents a scene containing multiple letters and starts the timer. Upon spotting the distinct letter, they must press 'Space' to stop the timer, and all letters turn into square placeholders. They then click on the square that covered the unique text to move forward in the experiment. If the user selects the wrong placeholder, the experiment records the error and repeats the scene with a new variation. This process continues, tracking the error count, until the user selects the correct placeholder. At the end of the experiment, participants can download a CSV log file containing a record of the trials they have completed.
